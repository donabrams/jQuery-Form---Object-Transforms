SHORT DESCR:
Utilities to convert forms to objects and and back again-- or apply an object to a form on a page

LONG DESCRIPTION:
Based on https://gist.github.com/615281
clearForm and clearFields taken from https://github.com/malsup/form.  That project is MIT licensed, and I consider those clear functions to NOT be substantial portions, but if malsup disagrees, I'll include the MIT license.  I'd rather add the dependency, but there's a lot of fluff there.

Adds the following functions to the jquery namespace:
$.flattenObject(toFlatten/{})->{}:
 Returns a map of the flattened object using dot/bracket notation ex.: ({a:{b:"",c:["",""]}}-> {'a.b': "", 'a.c': ["",""]}.  
 If any object keys in toFlatten contain a "." or "[", output is likely incorrect.  Empty objects and undefined values are ignored.
 Not circular reference safe.
$.fn.formToObj()->{}: 
 Takes the inputs, selects, and textareas and parses them into an object.  If names have a dot or [], parsed appropriately.
$.fn.objToForm(obj/{}, clearFirst/bool):
 Takes the object and places the variables into select, textarea, and input nodes of the same name.
 If clearFirst is true, will blank out the form before applying.
$.fn.clearForm():
 Clears or deselects all select, textarea, and input nodes contained.
$.fn.clearFields():
$.fn.clearInputs():
 Clears or deselects a select, textarea, and input node.

LICENSE:
Although this project's source is open (since it is javascript after all), all
of its content is copyright of University of Delaware and we have no policy on 
what license we can release things under without a lot of calling around. If 
you really want a license to use this, I'll try and help, but it will likely be
low priority-- so good luck. I'd personally recommend extracting the principles
from this code and doing something similar.
